# THE LOST DELIVERY

> Mission Status: **Under Development**

## Case Brief

**The Lost Delivery** is a custom mission for [PeekAPhone](https://peekaphone.com) made by [K4LM3D](https://kalmed.localplayer.dev).

> **Mission:** A high-priority delivery has vanished, and the only lead is the courier's unlocked phone found in the back of a rideshare car. Your job is to bypass the security layers and find the secret meeting location and the blackmailer.
> 
> Sift through text messages, track delivery points, and bypass encrypted apps to discover what was in the box—and who took it.

## Active Objective

**Current Task:** Designing the phone call logs, email inboxes, and many more.

> ***Estimated Deployment: To Be Announced***
